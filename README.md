# Numerical Methods for Root Finding

This repository contains implementations of various numerical methods for finding the roots of a function. Each method is organized into its own folder, containing the necessary code and explanations.

## Methods Implemented

- **Bisection Method**: A simple bracketing method that repeatedly bisects an interval and selects the subinterval in which the root lies.
- **False Position (False Rule) Method**: A modified version of the bisection method that uses a weighted average to improve convergence.
- **Newton-Raphson Method**: A powerful iterative method that uses derivatives to approximate the root.
- **Secant Method**: Similar to Newton-Raphson but does not require the calculation of derivatives, using a secant line instead.

## Folder Structure

- `Bisection/` - Contains the implementation of the Bisection Method.
- `False_Rule/` - Contains the implementation of the False Position Method.
- `Newton_Raphson/` - Contains the implementation of the Newton-Raphson Method.
- `Secant/` - Contains the implementation of the Secant Method.
- `README.md` - This document.

## Requirements

Each method is implemented using a programming language that should be mentioned in the specific folder. Ensure you have the necessary environment set up to run the implementations.

## Usage

Navigate to the respective folder and run the corresponding script to execute the method. Detailed instructions are provided in each folder.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute, feel free to submit pull requests with improvements, optimizations, or additional numerical methods.
